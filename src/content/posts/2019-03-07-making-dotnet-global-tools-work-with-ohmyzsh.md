I was trying to get a global .NET Core tool working on my development machine, which just so happens to be running macOS. I also work with [OhMyZsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) inside of [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/). Every time I would invoke the global tool I would get the following error:

```console
âžœ dotnet-project-licenses --help
zsh: command not found: dotnet-project-licenses
```

To fix this problem, I had to make sure that the `.dotnet/tools` directory was exported into my path. I can fix that by modifying my `~/.zshrc` file with the following lines.

```console
# dotnet global tools
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.dotnet/tools"
```

After restarting my terminal window, I was able to access all the .NET global tools I had installed. I hope this helps.
