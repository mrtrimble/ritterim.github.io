On July 18th, 2016 [the ASP.NET Monsters](https://twitter.com/aspnetmonsters) announced [a Summer Of Config](http://aspnetmonsters.com/2016/07/summerofconfig/) contest.

> The Summer of Config is all about creating the wackiest, most insane configuration provider that you can dream up. We want you jamminâ€™ on the ASP.NET Core code, bringing us your questions, experimenting with the code and seeing your creativity. BRING IT ON!

**So we did just that!** We had three entries:

1. [GPS Configuration provider](https://www.billboga.com/posts/creating-a-gps-configuration-provider-for-aspnet-core-10)
2. [Voice Recognition provider](http://rimdev.io/speech-recognition-configuration-provider-for-asp.net-core/)
3. [Twitter provider](https://www.billboga.com/posts/creating-a-twitter-configuration-provider-for-aspnet-core-10)

On September 1st, 2016 [Bill Boga](http://billboga.com) and [Khalid Abuhakmeh (me)](http://khalidabuhakmeh.com) won 1st and 2nd place respectively. Definitely a fun competition and congratulations to Bill Boga for blowing some minds and taking the victory (even if it was from me :P).
