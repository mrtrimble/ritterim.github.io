<div class="ui warning message">
  This post is getting old! See an updated version <a href="/welcome-new-hire-getting-started-in-frontend-at-rimdev/">here</a>
</div>

New to the frontend at RIMdev, or looking for more about our Frontend team? Here's a quick overview of our team, tools, and culture!

As a whole, RIMdev has always strived to use the technology that best suits the task. This post will give you a current overview, but software changes and so do we.

The majority of our frontend team are Mac users, so this post will seem Mac-biased, but rest assured, that's where it stops. We promote developers to use whichever platform makes them happiest.

## Communicating

Communication is at our core; we can accomplish more as our sum that we can as our parts, so we talk. About projects, goals, vision, and the path to get there. Slack is where we live, comment, post [gifs](https://giphy.com), [cat videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dsGWM5XGdg), ya know.

- [Slack](https://slack.com/)! We live here
- [MS Teams](https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software). Chat with non-slackers.
- Outlook

## Environment

We continue hard to deliver a great frontend experience to our users. In this section, you'll see the tools used to successfully build our experiences. On the frontend, most projects leverage [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/), [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), and, [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) heavily to build our Ritter Platform and family of static marketing sites.

- [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/) & [GitHub](https://github.com)
- [RBenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv): Ruby version management (for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/))

## That's really great, but what about professional development (me)?

### Conferences

Conferences are great opportunities to learn, be inspired, or inspire others by speaking! [VueConf](http://www.vueconf.us/) and [An Event Apart](https://aneventapart.com/) have become 2 of our top choices to date. We also encourage each member of our team to seek out new conferences.

### Writing

As a developer or designer, you're faced with unique challenges every day -- so are your peers. [Write about them!](https://rimdev.io) Share your solution with the community. None of us work in a vacuum, and how you approach a solution through code or design can help everyone.

### Open Source

We love Open Source, from [things we've made](https://rimdev.io/open-source/), to contributing to community projects and [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). Everyone on the team uses their personal GitHub account to build your community footprint. Some of our projects are private, although we keep much public in an effort to show your contributions.

### Ongoing

Our professional landscape changes constantly, so we adapt and learn all the things. We all learn differently so we make many options available: Instructor-led training, book reimbursements, subscriptions, whatever you need to succeed. Some examples of learning tools include [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/), [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/), [Vue Mastery](https://www.vuemastery.com/).
