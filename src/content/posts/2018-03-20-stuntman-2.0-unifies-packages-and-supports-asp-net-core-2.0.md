The [`RimDev.Stuntman`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RimDev.Stuntman/) NuGet package has reached version 2.0!

## Unified package with ASP.NET Core 2.0 Support

Both ASP.NET full framework and ASP.NET Core 2.0 supported by the [`RimDev.Stuntman`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RimDev.Stuntman/) package. The [`RimDev.Stuntman.AspNetCore`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RimDev.Stuntman.AspNetCore/) package has been unlisted from NuGet. 

If you need ASP.NET Core 1.x support you can continue using the [`RimDev.Stuntman.AspNetCore`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RimDev.Stuntman.AspNetCore/) unlisted package, but our current plans do not include support for ASP.NET Core 1.x going forward. But, that isn't set in stone -- we just don't plan to invest in this as a team.

## Ongoing development

The 2.0 release puts us in a great spot for future development! If you've used Stuntman or are excited about ASP.NET Core 2.0 support let us know in the comments!
