As I've walked through upgrading a number of solutions to target a new version of the .NET Framework, I've compiled a list of helpful steps:

- Run `git clean -xdf` to remove files not in the repository (or, delete `packages` folder, all `bin`, all `obj` folders)
- Update framework version on all projects
- Delete all binding redirects in all projects (search the solution for `<runtime>`)
- Package Manager Console: `Get-Project -All | Update-Package -Reinstall` (review for failures when complete, this may fail if any packages are delisted)
- Package Manager Console: `Get-Project -All | Add-BindingRedirect`
- Cleanup any unwanted files added by the reinstall of NuGet packages
- Cleanup duplicate entries of `<Private>True</Private>`
- Cleanup any other issues you may find (look through the changes)
- Build solution and review output for binding redirect issues or anything else

Hopefully that helps you avoid issues encountered when upgrading to a newer .NET framework version. Leave a comment if anything is missing!
