One of the perks being with [Ritter](https://jobs.ritterim.com/), and on the dev team, is you can choose the hardware that makes you happy and productive! Team members have the option of Windows or Mac, with refreshes every 3-4 years. Several Macs were due, but how to move forward? Intel's disappearing for Apple Silicon and we have clear ties to Microsoft in workflow and infrastructure, so waiting a bit on refreshes made sense. 

The wait is officially over! So here's a quick guide for anyone on the frontend upgrading now, or in the future! And by the way, #WorthIt! 

## Tooling
- Chrome (pushed automatically with Edge for macOS)
    - Extensions (core)

## Github

New laptop, new SSH key! You'll need to [generate](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) and [install](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) a new key for your GitHub account.  

## Static Sites

We run several flavors of [SSG](https://jamstack.org/generators/). If you find yourself working with one of them, you'll need _something_ from the list below üòÄ Most of them leverage [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/).

**Before working with _any_ static site**, install [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) - Apple Silicon, or `brew install git-lfs`, then initialize with `git lfs install` (you only need to run once per user account - it installs globally)

- Ruby/[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - [Installation guide for Apple M1](https://www.earthinversion.com/blogging/how-to-install-jekyll-on-appple-m1-macbook/) 
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)

## Happy coding with you're new Apple Silicon Macbook! ‚å®Ô∏è
