We ran across an issue where `window.exports` was being unexpectedly set.

## The cause

```html
<div id="exports">
  ...
</div>
```

## Why?

In some browsers, DOM elements with `id`s are available as variables automatically on `window`. When combined with functionality that checks if `window.exports` exists as part of environment detection there's the potential for an issue.
