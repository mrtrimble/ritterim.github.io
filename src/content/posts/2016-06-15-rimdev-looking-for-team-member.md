Our team is currently looking to add another senior developer to help with our current and future workloads at [Ritter Insurance Marketing](https://ritterim.com). Before we do, I thought I would write a little bit about who our team is, our values, our technology stack, and some of the challenges we face. The post is an attempt to enlighten perspective teammates and start a conversation with anyone interested.

## Challenges

The challenges we face as a team revolve around the insurance industry and providing services to agents across the United States. We solve problems related to the Medicare market, normally referred to as "over 65" in lingo. We also support the "under 65" market, by integrating directly with [Healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov) as a web broker. Our business is also very cyclical; the busiest time is leading up to the open enrollment period for both markets.

Our goals in the next years are to redesign and build a new system, so there will be a lot of opportunities to impact the direction of the business and develop applications that utilize current (and future) technologies.

## Culture

Our team culture can be summed up with one word: "Family". A fun atmosphere with open communication between team members, the business, and other stakeholders. We believe in a work/life balance with perks like 37 hour work weeks and remote privileges. We also believe in continued learning, and our developers regularly go to conferences, participate in developer communities, and write blog posts here. 

Our team believes we can affect positive change in the business, the agents we service, and ultimately their clients. The change we bring comes from being supportive of each other and pushing each other to be better.

## Technology

We are a polyglot team, distributed across two primary locations: Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Nampa, Idaho. Some of the development technologies we use include C# .NET, PHP, Jekyll, [GitHub](https://github.com), [AngularJs](https://angular.io), and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).  Our ASP.NET technology stack includes Windows Azure as our cloud environment, which we continuously deploy to. We are currently experimenting with .NET Core as a future platform.

I feel very proud of our involvement with open source software (OSS). We not only utilize OSS to accomplish our goals, but we also write and distribute our own through [nuget.org](https://nuget.org). As of writing this post, we have 12,509 downloads of our packages. We are conscious of the effect we can have outside of our business through OSS and we value that greatly. 

## What we are looking for

We are looking for a developer with experience in C# .NET, possibly 5+ years but the quality of the experience matters more than the quantity. Someone who understands working with GitHub, preferably with OSS work.  It is important that this individual has these traits:

- Working in a collaborative environment
- Contributing to the current conversation
- Being a self-starter
- A strong imagination and set of creative skills
- High ability to learn

## Conclusion

It is hard to distill a team of breathing living people into words. I hope this post sheds some light on our team. Feel free to ask questions in the comments, or reach out to any of us through social media. Our goal is to start a dialogue with potential team members and new friends. Thank you for your time and looking forward to talking to you.
