[Health checks in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/health-checks) are useful for reporting the health of your ASP.NET Core web application. But, this functionality can't directly be used with ASP.NET Full Framework applications.

That's where the [`RimDev.AspNet.Diagnostics.HealthChecks`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RimDev.AspNet.Diagnostics.HealthChecks) NuGet package steps in -- this package enables an experience similar to ASP.NET Core health checks on the full ASP.NET (non-Core) framework.

**Here's an example usage in an OWIN Startup class:**

```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)
    {
        app.UseHealthChecks(
            "/_health",
            new PingHealthCheck(
                new PingHealthCheckOptions()
                    .AddHost("localhost", 1000)));
    }
}
```
