We've spotted some strange behavior before with ASP.NET Core and JSON serialization/deserialization, and I eventually made it back to trying out some scenarios.

One thing I've noticed is the default `System.Text.Json` settings don't roundtrip (that is, serialize and deserialize) through the ASP.NET Core 3.1 TestServer (without additional configuration).

**The underlying issue is by default there's a character case mismatch.**

## Making It Work

One way to make it work is setting the property names case insensitive when deserializing the response:

```csharp
var responseObj = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<TestObject>(strContent, new JsonSerializerOptions
{
    // Required for test to pass, by default
    // there's a case mismatch that isn't automatically handled
    PropertyNamingPolicy = JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase
    // or
    // PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true
});
```

Alternatively, we could update the character case to match expectations via an attribute (`[JsonPropertyName("StringValue")]`) on each property.
