## What is a machine key?

According to [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.security.machinekey?view=netframework-4.7.2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.security.machinekey?view=netframework-4.7.2) a machine key "Provides a way to encrypt or hash data (or both) by using the same algorithms and key values that are used for ASP.NET forms authentication and view state."

## Where can I find it on Azure Web Apps?

It's on the file system at `D:\local\Config\rootweb.config`. One way to get there is navigate to **https://YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME.scm.azurewebsites.net**, click **Debug Console** on the top navigation, and choose CMD or PowerShell (whichever you prefer). Open the `rootweb.config` file and look for `machineKey`.

Hope you found this short post helpful!
