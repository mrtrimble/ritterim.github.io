## Update October 17, 2017

**This doesn't work with environment deployments, as this needs to run *after* the deployment has completed. See [http://help.appveyor.com/discussions/questions/8741-more-info-on-after_deploy](http://help.appveyor.com/discussions/questions/8741-more-info-on-after_deploy) for more information.**

For ASP.NET applications it can be useful to make a request to an application immediately after deployment to bring the application online. When using AppVeyor for push deployments, we can run this directly from AppVeyor!

Add the following to your **appveyor.yml** file:

```yaml
after_deploy:
  - ps: |
      if ($ENV:APPVEYOR_REPO_BRANCH -eq "master")
      {
        iex "curl https://production.example.org"
      }
      elseif ($ENV:APPVEYOR_REPO_BRANCH -eq "development")
      {
        iex "curl https://qa.example.org"
      }
```

If your users are lucky, AppVeyor will pay the start-up cost penalty a real human would normally experience. If luck is unacceptable, you may consider using a staging slot and only switch to production once your application is fully warmed up.
